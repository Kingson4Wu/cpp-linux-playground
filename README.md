A comprehensive hands-on C++ learning playground for Linux, covering modern C++ syntax, system programming, concurrent programming, network programming, and performance optimization.

## üéØ Project Goals

This repository provides a structured learning path for backend engineers to master C++ through progressive hands-on projects. By completing these projects, you will:

- Master modern C++ (C++11/14/17/20) core features
- Become proficient in Linux system calls, file I/O, and process/thread management
- Develop high-performance network services (TCP/HTTP, multiplexing)
- Learn performance optimization and engineering practices (memory pools, lock optimization, logging libraries, build tools)
- Build a portfolio of backend C++ projects to showcase your skills

## üöÄ Project Roadmap

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Language**: Modern C++ (C++11/14/17/20)
- **Platform**: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- **Build Tools**: CMake, Makefile
- **Debugging & Analysis**: GDB, Valgrind, Perf, AddressSanitizer
- **Networking**: Socket API, epoll, Reactor pattern
- **Testing**: Google Test framework
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development environment

## üèó Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended for consistent environment)
- Git
- Basic understanding of C++ and Linux

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-linux-playground.git
cd cpp-linux-playground

# Build Docker image
./scripts/docker-dev.sh build

# Start container
./scripts/docker-dev.sh run

# Enter container
./scripts/docker-dev.sh exec

# Build and run specific tools
./scripts/docker-dev.sh run-ls
./scripts/docker-dev.sh run-grep
./scripts/docker-dev.sh run-wc

# Run all tests
./scripts/docker-dev.sh test

# Debug with GDB
./scripts/docker-dev.sh debug

# Generate code coverage report
./scripts/docker-dev.sh coverage

# Stop container
./scripts/docker-dev.sh stop

# Clean up
./scripts/docker-dev.sh clean
```

**Note**: To improve development efficiency, different tasks use separate build directories:
- `run-*` and `debug` commands use the `build/` directory
- `test` command uses the `build-test/` directory
- `coverage` command uses the `build_coverage/` directory

This prevents unnecessary recompilation when switching between tasks.

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing

All projects include comprehensive unit tests using Google Test framework:

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/docker-dev.sh test

# Run specific test suite
./scripts/docker-dev.sh exec bash -c "cd /app/build && ./tests/phase1/cli-tools/ls_test"
```

### Code Coverage

To ensure code quality and test completeness, the project supports generating code coverage reports:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
./scripts/docker-dev.sh coverage
```

Coverage reports are generated in `build_coverage/coverage/`:
- HTML format: `build_coverage/coverage/index.html`
- XML format: `build_coverage/coverage/coverage.xml`

Target coverage: 90%+ to ensure core functionality is thoroughly tested.

### Static Analysis & Sanitizers

The project supports various static analysis tools and sanitizers:

```bash
# Build with AddressSanitizer
cmake -S . -B build-asan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_ASAN=ON
cmake --build build-asan

# Run with AddressSanitizer
./build-asan/phase1/cli-tools/my_ls
```
