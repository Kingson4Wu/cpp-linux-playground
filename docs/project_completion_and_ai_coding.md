# Linux C++ Backend Playground: From Scratch to AI-Assisted Development

If you want to systematically improve your C++ backend development skills while experiencing the full workflow of AI-assisted programming, the **[Linux C++ Playground project collection](https://github.com/Kingson4Wu/cpp-linux-playground)** is a great choice. It covers modern C++ syntax, system programming, multithreading, network programming, and performance optimization. Through a series of progressively challenging practice projects, you'll master core skills in a hands-on way.

Interestingly, all of the project code was generated by AI programming tools. My role was to design the learning roadmap, define specifications, and review the AI's work to ensure the code met standards, passed unit tests, and functioned as expected. This project demonstrates a highly efficient human-AI collaborative development workflow.

## Project Development Workflow Overview

### Stage 1: Fundamentals & Environment Setup

Everything starts with the basics:

1. **Repository Initialization**: Standard directory structure, Git configuration.
2. **Development Environment**: Unified setup with VSCode DevContainer, enabling development and debugging in a real Linux environment.
3. **Build System**: CMake with Debug/Release modes for efficient debugging and performance testing.
4. **Initial AI-Generated Features**:
   * Simple CLI tool library (`ls`, `grep`, `wc`)
   * DOM-style JSON parser
   * Thread-safe multithreaded logging library

> **Note**: I first asked AI to create a learning roadmap document. All specifications and features were implemented by AI, while I reviewed and guided iterations to meet standards.

### Stage 2: System Programming Practice

With the foundation laid, the focus shifts to system-level programming:

* **Multithreaded Downloader**: Implemented with libcurl and a thread pool.
* **Process Manager**: Similar to `ps`/`top` for system process monitoring.
* **Memory Pool Allocator**: Custom memory management with fixed and variable block strategies.

> **Note**: These features were fully coded by AI. My role was to review designs, ensure quality, and verify unit test coverage.

### Stage 3: Network Programming Projects

Hands-on projects for network programming include:

* **Multithreaded TCP Chatroom**: Supports multiple simultaneous client connections.
* **HTTP Static File Server**: Handles basic GET requests.
* **TCP File Transfer Service**: Implements reliable transmission over a custom protocol.

> **Note**: AI handled the full implementation. I reviewed plans and validated functionality after testing.

### Stage 4: Advanced Integrated Projects

Bringing together previous concepts to tackle complex challenges:

1. **Mini-Redis**: In-memory key-value store.
2. **Mini-Search**: Full-text search engine with inverted index and TF-IDF.
3. **High-Concurrency Web Crawler**: Distributed crawling with polite crawling strategies.

> **Note**: AI designed and optimized the entire implementation, while I conducted thorough manual validation.

## AI-Assisted Development in Action

The highlight of this project is its fully AI-driven coding workflow. The approach can be summarized as follows:

### 1. Clear Planning & Iterative Development

* **Before coding**: AI outputs a clear design plan and learning roadmap.
* **During coding**: AI writes code, creates unit tests, and implements features.
* **After coding**: I review code, validate features, and ensure all tests pass.

### 2. Effective Prompting Strategies

**Code generation example**:

```text
Implement [specific feature] in C++:
1. Use C++20 features
2. Follow src/ and include/ directory structure
3. Add error handling and resource management
4. Include Google Test unit tests
5. Follow project coding standards
```

**Code review example**:

```text
Review the following code, focusing on:
1. Memory safety
2. Thread safety
3. Performance optimization
4. Best practices
5. Project style compliance
```

**Debugging example**:

```text
The code has [problem description].
Analyze the cause and provide a fix.
```

> **Note**: AI rapidly delivers functional logic, tests, and optimizations. I focus on reviews and quality assurance.

### 3. Integrated AI Workflow

1. **Planning**: AI outputs a detailed development plan.
2. **Implementation**: AI generates code and unit tests.
3. **Testing**: AI creates test cases; I verify functionality.
4. **Documentation**: AI helps maintain documentation.

> **Note**: Coding and testing are automated by AI, while human review ensures quality and consistency.

### 4. Tools & Environment Setup

* **VSCode DevContainer**: Unified development environment, easily portable to Linux.
* **CMake**: Flexible build configuration for Debug/Release.
* **Google Test**: Unit testing framework.
* **gcovr + Sanitizers**: Code coverage, memory, and thread safety checks.
* **AI Context Files**: `PROJECT.md` + `.qwen/settings.json`

## Conclusion

The **[Linux C++ Backend Playground](https://github.com/Kingson4Wu/cpp-linux-playground)** project demonstrates:

* A progressive learning roadmap from fundamentals to advanced backend projects.
* System programming, concurrency, and networking essentials.
* Full AI-assisted coding workflow.
* Human-AI collaboration for efficient development and iterative refinement.

This approach lets AI handle most coding and testing tasks, while human developers focus on reviewing, validating, and ensuring consistency. It achieves both speed and quality in software development.
