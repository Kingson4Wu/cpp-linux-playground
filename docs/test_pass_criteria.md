# Test Pass Criteria

To determine if the tests pass successfully, follow these steps:

1. Execute the tests using the Docker development script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker-dev.sh test
   ```

2. Observe the output. A successful test run will show a line similar to:
   ```
   100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of XX
   ```
   where XX is the total number of tests executed.

3. Ensure the exit code of the command is 0, indicating successful completion without errors.

4. Verify that there are no failed tests listed in the output.

If all these conditions are met, the tests are considered to have passed.
