    // 1. Starting a server in a separate thread
    // 2. Creating a client that connects to the server
    // 3. Sending an upload request
    // 4. Verifying that the file was created on the server

    // Since this is a unit test, we're focusing on testing individual methods
    // rather than the full end-to-end functionality.
